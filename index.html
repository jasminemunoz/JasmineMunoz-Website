        <div class="subheading mb-5">Accountantüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jasmine Munoz and I am a freshman in college. I am majoring in mathematics at University of California, Riverside to become an accountant.I am a dedicated, determined, and hardworking person.Some of my previous jobs that I have worked at is a restaurant called Alfredo‚Äôs Pizza and Pasta working as a hostess and waitress.I hope to have my own business and become a real estate agent in the future. My purpose in life is to find out what I love to pursue to make myself happy and hopefully help out people that are in need. Departing from the homeland a person grew up in, could allow them to chase better job opportunities to pursue a better life. My father left everything he had in order to migrate from Mexico to the United States in the early 1980s. He decided to immigrate to the United States because he knew that he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to have a financially stable life as a cattle farmer and he needed money to help out his family with financial issues. My dad knew that if he came to the United States, he was going to be able to find a better job with a much higher income that would pay him enough to help out with the financial problems my grandparents had and would allow him to create a living of his own. When my dad first arrived here in1982, he went from job to job working at factories and warehouses that weren‚Äôt paying him enough money. Later on, he was able to find a financially stable job and began working as an independent distributor. Throughout this job, my dad was able to earn a steady income. With the higher salary, my dad would send money to my grandparents to help out with their house and medical bills. The job my dad had was able to support his family and himself, allowing him to start a life of his own and continuing to help out my grandparents. He was able to better his life by taking the chance to leave his homeland to explore the better job opportunities this country had to offer. This shows to me that sometimes people aren‚Äôt put in the best living situation, so they must leave to seek opportunities that will be beneficial for them in order to live a better life. With my father going through this demonstrates that moving away is a better choice rather than staying put because it comes with many more benefits. How can we better our lives, if we don‚Äôt try to explore the many opportunities there are? Wouldn‚Äôt people want to chase an opportunity that would better their life even if it meant you had to leave what you have behind? If we decided to stay settled, we would be narrowing our experiences and possibilities. Allowing ourselves to be open about these possibilities could lead to real-world experiences that shape a better life.<br><br>

        When I was ten years old I moved from Rialto to Californiania. I had a hard time adapting to a new city and school because I left all of my friends and had trouble making new ones. Leaving home could also come with the opportunity of pursuing a better education as an attempt to establish a better living. When my mom was 17 years old, she immigrated from Mexico to the United States so that she could be able to finish her education. My mom knew that the United States had a better education system than Mexico. She believed that the best option for her was to leave the country she grew up in and finish her high school education in the United States. When my mom immigrated here in 1991, she continued her senior year in San Gorgonio High School. This was very challenging for her because my mom didn‚Äôt know any English, which made it very difficult for her to learn in her classes. As time went by, she learned how to speak English and was able to adapt to the new environment. A few months later, my mom became the first person in her family to graduate from high school. After graduating, she decided to enroll at Valley College to take a certificate program on child growth and development in order to become a preschool teacher assistant. While attending community college, my mom was also working at a fast food restaurant to earn some money for herself. After my mom completed the courses at Valley College and got her certificate, she was able to find a job as a preschool assistant in Rialto. A good education wasn't something that her country was able to offer, so she had to make the decision to move somewhere else. This was very significant to my mother because she worked hard and was able to overcome her challenges to achieve this. With the education my mom received from living here, she was able to find a job that was able to support her family and herself. By leaving her family and chasing a greater education, my mom was able to create a better life. In Scott Russell Sanders article ‚ÄúStaying Put‚Äù, he describes how staying settled is more beneficial than trying to flee or challenge a conflict. Some of the benefits of staying put are continuing to establish or grow relationships and creating a permanent home for the future. Sander believes that because settling down in one place requires someone to devote a lot of time and effort, they‚Äôll be able to create something that will be valued and appreciated. Staying put in a particular place allows someone to embrace and admire their home, which makes it difficult for them to abandon it. Although Sanders argues that continuing to remain established brings many benefits, I think that departing from an area is a better option because a person will be able to seek better job and education opportunities to form a better living.<br><br>

        While listening to Mark Bittman‚Äôs speech about how the food we consume everyday could affect us and the world, I found it very surprising as he was explaining how unhealthy we eat everyday. Bittman goes on to explain that we overproduce and over consume meat, diary, and other junk foods which decreases our consumption of plants. As we continue to consume these unhealthy foods it is increasing the health and environmental problems in our world. Some of the potential consequences to ourselves if we continue the consumption of meat is that it will lead to various diseases such as diabetes, cancers, heart diseases, and strokes. These diseases are killing us because of the poor nutrients and the calories that are contained within our unhealthy foods. Everyday we consume more calories than we need to which could lead to having these types of diseases. Most of the food that we eat today is processed which lacks many nutrients and is unhealthy for our body. For example, one of my coworkers that I used to work with passed away because of his obesity which caused him to have diabetes. Due to all the unhealthy food he was consuming and the calories these foods contained led him to become obesed. Later on, he was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple years later he passed away by having a heart attack in his sleep. This describes one of Bittman‚Äôs main points about how eating all this junk food could end up killing us. If we continue to live with this diet and lifestyle more people are going to obtain these health diseases that are going to kill us.Bittman also states that if we keep eating this regular diet, this will increase our pollution and global warming. A portion of the greenhouse gases is created by our livestock production. The greenhouse gases such as methane, have a higher effect on our global warming. Our livestock is also responsible for land degradation, air and water pollution, and water shortages. Other animals that we eat such as fish, release carbon in the air when they are being transported across the country which increases pollution. This pollution could also increase the probability of having these health diseases. The pollution and global warming caused by our livestock production is slowly destroying our Earth. A resolution that  Bittman believes would help us and the world would be to eat less meat and consume more plants. I would have to agree with this idea because by consuming more plants we would become healthier by digesting good nutrients that are better for us. Also, increasing the consumption of plants would decrease our pollution. In order to live a healthier lifestyle and have a cleaner environment we must decrease our consumption of meat and eat better foods. To achieve this we need to promote a better diet and encourage everyone to consume more plants.Everyday we consume more calories than we need to which could lead to having these types of diseases. Most of the food that we eat today is processed which lacks many nutrients and is unhealthy for our body.
